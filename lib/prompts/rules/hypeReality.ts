export const HYPE_VS_REALITY_RULES = `⚠️ MANDATORY: HYPE vs REALITY VERIFICATION (BEFORE including ANY news):
1. CROSS-VERIFY: Check multiple sources before including any AI news/claim
2. NO FEAR-MONGERING: Avoid sensationalist headlines about job losses, AI doom
3. BALANCED VIEW: If including AI impact on jobs, ALWAYS include:
   - Jobs CREATED by AI (not just displaced)
   - Skills that remain valuable
   - Adaptation opportunities
4. FACT-CHECK: Verify statistics, don't use clickbait numbers
5. NO HYPE: Reject exaggerated claims ("AI will replace all jobs by 2025")
6. REALITY FOCUS: Use peer-reviewed research, official reports over blog posts

BAD (Fear-mongering): "AI will eliminate 80% of jobs in 5 years"
GOOD (Balanced): "AI automates routine tasks while creating new specialist roles"

BAD (Hype): "AGI is imminent and will surpass humans"
GOOD (Reality): "Current AI excels at narrow tasks but lacks general reasoning"

REASON: Learners should understand AI realistically, not fear it`;
