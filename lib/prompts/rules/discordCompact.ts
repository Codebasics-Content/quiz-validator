export const DISCORD_COMPACT_RULES = `⚠️ DISCORD COMPACT FORMATS - LEARNER PSYCHOLOGY RULES:

COGNITIVE LOAD: MAX 2 statements ONLY | Each statement MAX 12 words | Readable at a glance
MOBILE-FIRST: No scrolling | Compact stem | Short options
TIME PRESSURE: If can't read in 5 seconds, it's TOO LONG

FORMAT DISTRIBUTION: Statement-based 40% | Direct 30% | Assertion-Reason 10% | Match 10% | Negative 10%

⚠️ NATURAL TONE - NOT AI-GENERATED:
- Options must COMPLETE the question grammatically
- Read question + option as ONE sentence → must sound natural
- Avoid fragmented phrases: "Edge-first priority" ❌ → "Prioritizing edge computing" ✓
- Avoid declarative slogans: "Cloud obsolete" ❌ → "Cloud dependency is declining" ✓
- Options should sound like something a human would SAY, not BULLET POINTS`;

export const QUESTION_STYLE_RULES = `QUESTION STYLE - DISCORD COMPACT (Not verbose UPSC):

⚠️ DISCORD REALITY vs UPSC EXAM:
- UPSC: 2 hours, paper, no distractions → verbose OK
- Discord: 20-35s, GIFs, mobile, chaos → COMPACT REQUIRED

COMPACT STYLE RULES:
- Direct questions preferred (30%): "What drives X?" "Why did Y happen?"
- Statement-based ONLY when needed (40%): MAX 2 short statements
- Each statement: 8-10 words MAX, no subordinate clauses
- Question stem: 15-20 chars MAX ("About AI energy:")
- Options: Single words or 2-3 word phrases

GOOD EXAMPLES:
Question: "What PRIMARY factor drives AI datacenter energy surge?"
Options: "Extended computation chains" ✓ | "Reasoning requires more steps" ✓ | "Model size growth" ✓

Question: "Why are SLMs gaining industry adoption?"
Options: "They enable on-device AI" ✓ | "Edge deployment is cheaper" ✓ | "Cloud costs are rising" ✓

BAD OPTIONS (FRAGMENTED/ROBOTIC):
❌ "Edge-first priority" → ✓ "Industry prioritizes edge deployment"
❌ "Large models gone" → ✓ "Large models are being replaced"
❌ "Cloud obsolete" → ✓ "Cloud computing is becoming outdated"
❌ "AI research declining" → ✓ "AI research investment is falling"

QUESTION-OPTION GRAMMAR TEST:
- "What trend does this indicate?" + "Edge-first priority" = BROKEN ❌
- "What trend does this indicate?" + "Industry is prioritizing edge AI" = NATURAL ✓

AVOID:
- Fragmented noun phrases as options (sounds like bullet points)
- Options that don't complete the question grammatically
- Long preambles ("A recent report by X found that...")
- Verbose statement options ("1 and 2 only" → "1,2")`;
